So you may have seen github codespaces and maybe even given it a go!

But now it's public and I decided to use it for my web based projects. And I'm going to explain why.

So Github Codespaces let you develop your code on a cloud machine and either run vs-code in your browser or connect to it from your app. Now I decided to use it in the browser for a reason I will tell you shortly.

But first, here's a few reasons why I like codespaces:

  - It saves space on my local machine, especially `node_modules` if I ever work with that.
  - It lets me start a project quicker. I doesn't take nearly as long to install libraries and etc.
  - I can work with frameworks/languages I haven't worked with before with ease
  - It runs fast. (This wasn't a problem before as I use a Macbook Air M1, but still)

Now why did I choose to use vscode in the browser?
The reason is because I use a browser called Arc. It's got a short waiting list, at the moment but it's very good and has a nice feature called split view that lets you have two websites side by side in one browser window. Here's an image:

You can see some more about Arc Browser [here](httos://www.arc.net)

So that's why I switched to Github Codespaces for all my web projects.
