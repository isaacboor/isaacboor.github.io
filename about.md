Hi there! I'm Isaac. A casual programmer, video editor and creative person. 

## Things I've made

I haven't made a lot but here's a couple things from newest to oldest.

### 09 Murders

A project that me and my friend Ashton (and his friends) have been working on as of late. It's a YouTube 'horror' Channel and I've been editing all the episodes. We plan for this to be a major long-term project so I'll mostly be working on this for a while.

### ashtxn_g

This is my friend Ashton's main youtube channel. He posts videos about Apple products. He has an impressive collection of iPhones, iPads and iPod. I edit most of his main videos and created his website.

### Flagz

I've become interested in Geography recently, so I made a simple flag guessing game.

### Message Tricks

A page that makes your text look weird, to make your friends confused.
