Hi, I'm Isaac and I'm a casual programmer and video editor.

### Programming

I mainly work on the things on this website. You can look at the things I've made on my [projects page](/tag/project).

### Video Editing

I do some editing for my friend Ashton and his youtube channel [ashtxn_g](https://www.youtube.com/@ashtxn_g). Recently a second channel has been made with a couple of his friends called [09 Murders](https://www.youtube.com/@09murders), a 'horror' series.

### Setup

This is my hardware and software setup

- Macbook Air 2020 8GB
