Hi there! I'm Isaac. A casual programmer, video editor and creative person from the UK.

This website is a place for me to share the stuff I make, and give me something to do instead of watching youtube or playing video games.

Here's a quick setup list:

* Computer: Macbook Air 2020 M1
* Video Editor: DaVinci Resolve
